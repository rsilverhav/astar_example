This is a simple project implementing the A* algorithm in C++. The algorithm is implemented without diagonal movement.

To make and run the project, use "./run" in terminal.

The world to solve is read from the file "map.txt" where '1' is a wall and '0' is floor.

The start and target for the solver is set in the main.cpp file.
